        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>

            <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3/4 pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>

        </ul>

        <h4>Steps to make</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
            <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
            <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>

        </ol>
