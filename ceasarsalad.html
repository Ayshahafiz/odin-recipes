            <li>Heavy pinch of salt</li>

            <li>1 clove of garlic , minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon anchovy paste</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon coarse salt</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375^F.</li>
            <li>Drizzle bread cubes with enough olive oil so they are all very lightly coated. Toss and add salt.</li>
            <li>Spread out onto a sheet pan and bake until edges turn brown, 7-10 minutes. Keep a close eye on them so they don't burn, stir and toss them as needed.</li>
            <li>Set aside while you prepare the rest of the salad. Can be made several days in advance and stored in an airtight container.</li>
            <li>Whisk together all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Store in the fridge until ready to use. Can be made at least 1 week in advance.</li>
            <h5>ASSEMBLE THE SALAD:</h5>
            <li>In a large bowl, toss the lettuce with enough dressing to lightly coat the leaves (or to your preference). You may not need all of the dressing.</li>
            <li>Add half of the croutons and Parmesan cheese and toss again.</li>
            <li>Top with remaining croutons and cheese and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
